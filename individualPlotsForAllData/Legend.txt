Legend for the files in this directory:
Files whose name starts with 16S contain plots for each taxon from 16S rRNA sequencing at the phylogenetic level given at the end of the name, in the order they appear in Supplementary Table S2. Log relative abundance is plotted against urban/rural status, time and patient ID, with the adjusted p-values from the linear model given in the title. 
The files whose name starts with metabolon or metadata contain the plots for each metabolite or metadata variable respectively, in the order they appear in Supplementary Table S2, with the adjusted P-values from the linear model given in the title. 
Files whose names start with kraken contain plots for each taxon from whole genome sequencing at the phylogenetic level given at the end of the name, in the order they appear in Supplementary Table S5. Log relative abundance is plotted against urban/rural status, with the adjusted P-values from the linear model given in the title. 
Similarly, files whose names start with humann contain plots for each gene against urban/rural status, with the linear model adjusted P-values in the title, in the order they appear in Supplementary Table S5.
These PDFs are all outputs from the model results for each type of data (otuModel_16s.R, metabolonModel.R, metadataModel.R, minikraken_otuModel_China.R, and humann_otuModel_China_unlog.R)
