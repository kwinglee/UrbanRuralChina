pValueComparisonLMvsNonparam_wgs_log.jpg: Linear model and nonparametric P-values are highly correlated.
Comparison of the unadjusted P-values from a Wilcoxon rank sum test to the linear model unadjusted P-values for the whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. The Spearman correlation is given in the title.

pValueHistogram.jpg: Our P-value histograms are highly skewed to the left, indicating a strong difference between urban and rural that is not due to overfitting. 
Histograms of the linear model p-values for the 16S rRNA sequencing results (16S) or whole genome sequencing results (WGS). pChi indicates the result of a Pearson’s chi-squared test while pKS indicates the result of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, both with a null hypothesis of a uniform distribution.
